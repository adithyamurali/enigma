# This a Makefile, an input file for the GNU 'make' program.  For you 
# command-line and Emacs enthusiasts, this makes it possible to build
# this program with a single command:
#     make 
# You can also clean up junk files and .class files with
#     make clean
# To run style61b (our style enforcer) over your source files, type
#     make style
# Finally, you can run any tests you'd care to with
#     make check
# This first runs your program on the input files tests/*.inp and checks
# to see that it completes normally and that the results are those in the
# files tests/*.out.  It also runs the program on the input files tests/*.err
# and checks that the program properly reports an error as given in the
# specification. It's up to you to come up with the test files; the 
# skeleton just includes some simple samples.
