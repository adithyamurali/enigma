Hello world
* B BETA III IV I BLEY
The Bombola faints in the hot Bowral tree
Where fierce Mullengudgerys smothering fires
Far from the breezes of Coolgardie
Burn ghastly and blue as the day expires
And Murriwillumba complaineth in song
For the garlanded bowers of Woolloomooloo
And the Ballarat Fly and the lone Wollongong
They dream of the gardens of Jamberoo
The wallabi sighs for the Murrubidgee
For the velvety sod of the Munno Parah
Where the waters of healing from Muloowurtie
Flow dim in the gloaming by Yaranyackah
The Koppio sorrows for lost Wolloway
And sigheth in secret for Murrurundi
The Whangeroo wombat lamenteth the day
That made him an exile from Jerrilderie
* B BETA III IV I AXLE
FROM his shoulder Hiawatha
Took the camera of rosewood
Made of sliding folding rosewood
Neatly put it all together
In its case it lay compactly
Folded into nearly nothing
But he opened out the hinges
Pushed and pulled the joints
   and hinges
Till it looked all squares
   and oblongs
Like a complicated figure
In the Second Book of Euclid

The Phoenix and the Turtle
Let the bird of loudest lay
On the sole Arabian tree
Herald sad and trumpet be
To whose sound chaste wings obey
But thou shrieking harbinger
Foul precurrer of the fiend
Augur of the fevers end
To this troop come thou not near
From this session interdict
Every fowl of tyrant wing
Save the eagle featherd king
Keep the obsequy so strict
Let the priest in surplice white
That defunctive music can
Be the deathdivining swan
Lest the requiem lack his right
And thou trebledated crow
That thy sable gender makst
With the breath thou givst and takst
Mongst our mourners shalt thou go
Here the anthem doth commence
Love and constancy is dead
Phoenix and the turtle fled
In a mutual flame from hence
So they lovd as love in twain
Had the essence but in one
Two distincts division none
Number there in love was slain
Hearts remote yet not asunder
Distance and no space was seen
Twixt the turtle and his queen
But in them it were a wonder
